# KrunkDumper
A dump of the source code from the latest version of Krunker.io. You can easily view and download the source code from this repository for any needs you need. Please note that this repository may not be updated everyday 24/7 as I have other things to tend to instead of a GitHub repository all day.

# [!] Attention [!]
I do not own ANY of the code in this repository! Krunker.io, the source code, assets, and everything else are owned by Yendis Entertainment and copyrighted by Yendis Entertainment. Now I can't stop you from using any of the code in a malicious way but please do not do so as it's retarded. You could probably make hacks using the code but I'm not to sure but do whatever I can't stop you from you doing what your doing. It's your fault not mine.

> Please note that this code isn't owned by me but Yendis Entertainment. They own the Krunker.io game and code and I do not. I don't feel like getting sued over a GitHub Repostiory so I'm here to say this is just a repository for learning purposes of the game and I don't mean to cause any problems with the game and other things.
